## FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES & CALCULATIONS

### Portland Cement Chemistry

**Main Phases (Bogue calculation from oxide composition):**

| Phase | Chemical Formula | Hydration Speed | Contribution |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **C₃S** (Alite) | 3CaO·SiO₂ | Fast (days) | Early strength |
| **C₂S** (Belite) | 2CaO·SiO₂ | Slow (months-years) | Long-term strength |
| **C₃A** (Aluminate) | 3CaO·Al₂O₃ | Very fast (hours) | Flash set, sulfate attack vulnerability |
| **C₄AF** (Ferrite) | 4CaO·Al₂O₃·Fe₂O₃ | Intermediate | Minor strength, color |

**Hydration reactions:**
```
2C₃S + 6H → C₃S₂H₃ + 3Ca(OH)₂  (main strength-producing reaction)
2C₂S + 4H → C₃S₂H₃ + Ca(OH)₂   (long-term strength)
```

**Heat of hydration:** ~120 cal/g for typical Portland cement (critical for HPHT thickening time)

### API Cement Classes

| Class | Application | Properties | Typical Depth |
|-------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **A** | Surface (0-1,830 m / 0-6,000 ft) | General purpose, no special properties | Shallow |
| **B** | Surface to moderate depth | Moderate sulfate resistance | 0-1,830 m |
| **C** | Surface, high early strength | Accelerated, 24-hr strength ~8 MPa | Shallow, fast WOC |
| **D, E, F** | Intermediate to deep | Retarded for higher BHT | 1,830-4,270 m |
| **G, H** | General purpose, all depths | Most versatile, additive base | Universal |
| **J** | Very deep, HPHT | Highly retarded, pressure-resistant | >3,960 m / >13,000 ft |

**Most common:** Class G and H (identical except fineness) - used worldwide with appropriate additives for specific conditions

### Volume Calculations

**Slurry yield (ft³/sk or m³/ton):**
```
Yield = (Vw + Vc) / Wc

Where:
Vw = Volume of mix water (gal or L)
Vc = Absolute volume of cement (ft³ or m³)
Wc = Weight of cement (sacks or kg)
```

**Annular volume:**
```
V_annular = (D_hole² - D_casing²) × 0.7854 × Length / 1029  (bbls, inches, ft)
V_annular = (D_hole² - D_casing²) × π/4 × Length  (m³, meters)
```

**Cement required:**
```
Cement (sacks) = V_annular × Excess% × (1/Yield)

Typical excess: 50-75% surface, 30-50% intermediate, 20-30% production
```

**Number of centralizers (API RP 10D-2):**
```
Minimum spacing = Lesser of 40 ft or casing joint length
Optimal: Every joint in critical zones (top 500 ft, weak formations, gas zones)
```

### Thickening Time Requirements

**API RP 10B-2 Schedule:**
- **BHST (Bottomhole Static Temperature):** Formation temperature at depth
- **BHCT (Bottomhole Circulating Temperature):** Temperature during circulation (typically 10-40°F below BHST)
- **Schedule:** Simulates wellbore conditions (pressure + temperature profile vs time)

**Acceptance criteria:**
```
Thickening time: 30-100 Bc at BHCT (minimum)
Typical target: 2-3× estimated job time for safety margin

Where Bc = Bearden units of consistency (70 Bc = unpumpable, 100 Bc = set)
```

**Temperature correction (Downes equation):**
```
BHCT = 0.62 × BHST + 0.38 × Tsurface
```

### Compressive Strength Development

**API RP 10B-2 requirements:**

| Time | Minimum Strength | Application |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| **8 hours** | 3.5 MPa (500 psi) | Wait-on-cement (WOC) before drilling out |
| **24 hours** | 8.3 MPa (1,200 psi) | Pressure testing |
| **72 hours** | Design strength | Long-term zonal isolation |

**Typical development curve (Class G at 80°C):**
- 8 hours: 5-10 MPa
- 24 hours: 15-25 MPa
- 7 days: 30-40 MPa
- 28 days: 35-45 MPa (stable)

**Temperature effects:**
- Higher temperature → faster strength development
- >110°C (230°F) without silica flour → **strength retrogression** (conversion of CSH to α-C₂SH, weaker)
- Silica flour (35-40% BWOC) prevents retrogression by forming stable tobermorite

### Mud Removal and Displacement Efficiency

**Critical principle:** Cement cannot bond to mud - mud removal is **#1 factor** in cement job success

**Displacement mechanisms:**
1. **Mechanical:** Pipe movement (rotation/reciprocation), turbulent flow, standoff
2. **Chemical:** Surfactants, solvents, thinners (spacer chemistry)

**Spacer design requirements:**
```
Density: MW < ρ_spacer < ρ_cement (bracketing - prevents intermixing)
Rheology: τ_spacer > τ_mud AND τ_spacer > τ_cement (wiper action)
Contact time: ≥10 minutes (annular volume / flow rate)
Compatibility: Test spacer-mud and spacer-cement for contamination
```

**Turbulent flow targeting:**
```
Reynolds Number (Re) = 928 × ρ × v × D_h / μ

Re > 2,100 = Turbulent (desired for mud removal)
Re < 2,100 = Laminar (poor mud removal)

where:
ρ = density (ppg)
v = velocity (ft/min)
D_h = hydraulic diameter (inches)
μ = viscosity (cp)
```

**Standoff impact:**
- 0% standoff → channeling, mud pockets
- 67% standoff → minimum acceptable
- **80-90% standoff → optimal** (target for critical zones)

### Contamination and Mixing

**Cement-mud mixing zones:**
- **Lead edge:** Spacer-cement interface (~5-10 bbls transition)
- **Tail edge:** Cement-mud interface (~5-10 bbls transition)

**Effects of contamination:**
- 10% mud → ~30% strength loss
- 20% mud → ~60% strength loss + extended thickening time
- >30% mud → may not set properly

**Prevention:**
- Proper spacer design and volume
- Avoid over-displacement (maintain cement in annulus)
- Account for plug volume and U-tube effect
- Real-time density monitoring

## SLURRY DESIGN FOR SPECIFIC CONDITIONS

### HPHT Wells (>150°C / 300°F)

**Critical considerations:**
- Strength retrogression at >110°C without silica flour
- Accelerated thickening time (heat of hydration + formation temperature)
- Thermal expansion/contraction cycling

**Design approach:**
```
HPHT SLURRY FORMULATION

```

### Deepwater/Subsea (Low Temperature)

**Challenges:**
- Low mudline temperature (35-45°F / 2-7°C)
- Extended thickening time required (rig time, logistics)
- Dual-gradient environment (seawater + mud)

**Design approach:**
```
DEEPWATER SLURRY FORMULATION

Base: Class G or H cement

COLD TEMPERATURE SECTION (Mudline to 500 ft below):
├─ Accelerator: CaCl₂ (2-4% BWOC) or seawater (50-100% BWOW)
│  └─ Maintains pumpability at low temperature
├─ Anti-settling agent: Maintain suspension in cold

└─ Density: 13.5-15.0 ppg (avoid losses in weak formations)

WARM SECTION (Below 500 ft):
├─ Retarder: 0.1-0.3% BWOC
├─ Transition slurry if large temperature gradient
└─ Standard fluid loss control

DV (Displacement Vessel) CONSIDERATIONS:
├─ Batch mixing surface (precise control)
├─ Storage in DV during subsea operations
├─ Pumping via subsea lines
└─ Avoid contamination during transfer

TESTING:
├─ Thickening time: Simulate full temperature profile (cold start → warm)
├─ Sedimentation: Static gel strength @ mudline temperature
└─ Compatibility: Seawater, subsea mud, spacer
```

### Lost Circulation Zones

**Severity classification:**
- **Seepage:** <10 bbl/hr
- **Partial losses:** 10-50 bbl/hr
- **Severe losses:** 50-500 bbl/hr
- **Total losses:** >500 bbl/hr (or complete loss of returns)

**Design approach by severity:**

```
LOST CIRCULATION SLURRY DESIGN

SEEPAGE TO PARTIAL:
├─ Lightweight cement: 11.5-13.5 ppg
│  ├─ Extenders: Bentonite (2-16% BWOC) or pozzolan

│  ├─ Concentration: 5-15 ppg in slurry
│  └─ Types: Gilsonite, walnut hulls, resilient graphite
└─ Fluid loss: <50 mL/30min (prevent dehydration/bridging)

SEVERE LOSSES:
├─ Stage cementing: Isolate loss zone, cement above/below separately
├─ Dump squeeze: Place LCM pill, dump cement, squeeze
├─ Coarse LCM: Larger particles + fibers
├─ Thixotropic slurry: Controlled gel strength development
└─ Diesel-bentonite squeeze (extreme cases)

TOTAL LOSSES:
├─ DO NOT PUMP CEMENT (will lose entire volume)
├─ Option 1: Liner top packer + annular pack-off
├─ Option 2: Stage tool isolation
├─ Option 3: Drillable bridge plug below loss zone
└─ Consult Drilling Engineer and Geomechanics Specialist
```

### Salt Sections

**Challenges:**
- Salt creep (time-dependent deformation)
- Fluid loss into salt (dehydration)
- Requirement for saturated brine compatibility
- Ductile cement needed (resist creep loading)

**Design approach:**
```
SALT SECTION SLURRY

Base: Class G + saturated NaCl or CaCl₂ brine

REQUIRED PROPERTIES:
├─ Mix water: Saturated salt brine (prevent dissolution)
│  └─ NaCl: 37% by weight (fully saturated)
│  └─ CaCl₂: Higher density option
├─ Flexible system: Low E-modulus (2,000-6,000 MPa vs 10,000+ conventional)
│  └─ Latex: 10-15% BWOC (elastomeric properties)
│  └─ Special flexibility additives
├─ Expansion: Offset shrinkage + creep loading
│  └─ Expansion additive: 1-5% BWOC
├─ Fluid loss: <50 mL/30min (prevent bridging in salt)
└─ Accelerator: May be needed (high salt content retards)

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES:
├─ Compressive strength: 3,000-5,000 psi @ 24hr (adequate but not excessive)
├─ Young's Modulus: 2,000-6,000 MPa (flexible)
├─ Tensile strength: >300 psi
└─ Ductility: High (resist crack propagation)

PLACEMENT:

├─ Minimize static time (salt creep starts immediately)
├─ WOC: Sufficient for strength but avoid excessive (creep increases with time)
└─ Monitor for casing movement during WOC
```

### Sour Service (CO2/H2S)

**Degradation mechanisms:**
- CO2 + Ca(OH)₂ → CaCO₃ (carbonation - can be beneficial if controlled, harmful if extensive)
- H2S + cement → calcium sulfide compounds (strength loss)
- Combined CO2/H2S (synergistic attack)

**Design approach:**
```
SOUR SERVICE SLURRY

SULFATE ATTACK RESISTANCE:
├─ Low C₃A cement: <3% C₃A (Class H or V)
├─ Pozzolanic additives: Fly ash 20-40% BWOC, microsilica 5-10%
│  └─ Consume Ca(OH)₂ (vulnerable phase)
│  └─ Densify microstructure (reduce permeability)
└─ Silica flour: 35-40% BWOC (forms stable CSH)

CO2 RESISTANCE:
├─ Dense microstructure: Low permeability (<0.1 md)
├─ Low free water: <0.5% (prevents CO2 transport)
├─ Carbonation control: May add CO2-resistant polymers
└─ Avoid excessive Ca(OH)₂ (pozzolan consumption)

H2S RESISTANCE:
├─ Latex: 10-15% BWOC (reduce permeability, flexibility)

├─ Permeability: <0.1 md throughout well life
└─ Long-term stability: 28-day minimum testing
```

---

## HYDRAULICS AND PLACEMENT MODELING

### ECD During Cementing

**Critical for narrow margin wells:**
```
ECD_cement = ρ_static + ΔP_annular/(0.052 × TVD)

Components:
├─ Static density: Spacer, cement, mud densities
├─ Annular friction: Higher for viscous cement
├─ Gel breaking: Mud gels must be broken (pressure spike)
└─ Plug bump: Sudden pressure increase when top plug lands
```

**Maximum ECD must not exceed fracture gradient:**
- Monitor real-time bottomhole pressure
- Reduce pump rate if approaching frac gradient
- May require staged cementing or lightweight systems

### Flow Regime Optimization

**Target turbulent flow in annulus for mud removal:**

**Critical velocity for turbulence:**
```
v_critical = 1.08 × (PV + 5×YP) / ρ / D_h

Pump rate: Q = v × A_annulus × 2.448  (bpm for ft/min, in²)
```

**Practical limits:**
- Maximum pump rate: Limited by surface equipment, ECD, wellhead rating
- Minimum pump rate: Maintain turbulence, avoid settling
- Typical: 5-12 bpm (depends on annular clearance)

**Software simulation (OptiCem, CemCADE):**
- Pre-job: Optimize densities, volumes, rates
- Post-job: Analyze actual vs predicted, calibrate models

---

## CEMENT EVALUATION

### CBL/VDL Interpretation

**CBL (Cement Bond Log) - Amplitude measurement:**
```
Bond Index (BI) = (E1 - E3) / (E1 - E2) × 100

Where:
E1 = Free pipe amplitude (no cement)
E2 = Well-bonded amplitude (reference)
E3 = Measured amplitude

BI > 80% = Good bond
BI 50-80% = Fair bond
BI < 50% = Poor bond
```

**VDL (Variable Density Log) - Waveform display:**
- **Dark (fast arrival, low amplitude):** Good bond - acoustic energy absorbed by formation
- **Light (slow arrival, high amplitude):** Poor bond - pipe resonance, channeling
- **Chevron patterns:** Casing collar reflections
- **Formation arrivals:** Indicates good cement bond allowing formation signal

**Acceptance criteria (typical):**
- Critical zones (gas, high pressure): BI > 80%, no channeling on VDL
- Non-critical zones: BI > 60% acceptable
- Top of cement verification: Amplitude increase + VDL change

### Ultrasonic Imaging Tools

**Technology advantages over CBL:**
- 360° coverage (vs single azimuthal measurement)
- Quantitative: Cement acoustic impedance, thickness
- Detects: Microannulus, channels, voids, eccentricity

**Isolation Scanner / CAST-V interpretation:**
- **Impedance map:** Color-coded cement quality around circumference
- **Cement thickness:** Radial dimension measurement
- **Solid/liquid discrimination:** Gas channels show as liquid
- **Quantitative metrics:** % bonded area, average impedance

### Remediation Decision Matrix

```
CEMENT EVALUATION RESULTS

GOOD BOND (BI > 80%, no channeling):
└─ Action: Accept, pressure test, drill out

FAIR BOND (BI 50-80%, minor channeling):
├─ Non-critical zone: Accept with monitoring
└─ Critical zone: Consider remediation vs risk acceptance

POOR BOND (BI < 50%, significant channeling):
├─ Gas zone: MANDATORY remediation (squeeze)
├─ Water zone: Evaluate cross-flow risk → remediate if significant
├─ Non-productive: May accept with approval
└─ Technique: Perforation squeeze or annular squeeze

NO CEMENT (Free pipe amplitude, no VDL attenuation):
├─ Depth: Determine top of cement (TOC)
├─ If TOC < planned: Top job required
├─ If TOC adequate but channels: Squeeze
└─ If total absence: Re-run casing, cement
```

## GAS MIGRATION CONTROL

### Mechanisms

**Four primary mechanisms:**

1. **Mud-cement transition period (gelation):**
   - Mud gel strength > cement gel strength initially
   - Gas can migrate upward through liquid cement
   - Critical period: 0.5-4 hours after placement

2. **Osmotic pressure:**
   - Water loss from cement to formation
   - Creates pressure differential driving gas influx

3. **Cement permeability:**
   - Micro-channels during hydration
   - After setting but before impermeability developed

4. **Cement shrinkage:**
   - Volume reduction during setting
   - Creates microannulus for gas path

### Design Solutions

├─ Particle size: <10 μm (vs ~15 μm conventional)
├─ Application: Microfractures, microannulus, high-perm formations
├─ Permeability: Can penetrate <1 md formations
└─ Mix: 50-100% micro-fine, balance conventional

THIXOTROPIC SQUEEZE:
├─ Rapid gel development: Prevent fallback
├─ Bentonite: 2-4% BWOC
└─ Application: Gas perforations, high-angle wells

ADDITIVES:
├─ Dispersant: Improve flow into tight spaces
├─ Expansion: Ensure contact after placement
└─ Antifoam: Critical (prevent gas blocking)
```

**Success criteria:**
- Pressure builds to target squeeze pressure
- Pressure holds on bleed-back (no rapid decline)
- Subsequent pressure test (FIT/LOT) meets requirements
- Temperature log or noise log confirms placement (if run)

### Multiple Squeeze Attempts

**When first squeeze fails:**

**Typical progression:**
1. **First attempt:** Standard squeeze (HP or LP)
2. **Second attempt:** Adjust technique (switch HP↔LP, add hesitation)
3. **Third attempt:** Change slurry (micro-fine, thixotropic, higher density)
4. **Fourth attempt:** Change interval (isolate smaller section, use different perforations)
5. **Fifth+ attempt:** Consider alternatives:
   - Mechanical isolation (bridge plug + packer)
   - Section mill and re-cement
   - Abandon interval if non-critical

**Learning from failures:**
- Analyze pressure plots (where is cement going?)
- Temperature surveys (identify thief zones)
- Noise logs (detect flow paths)
- Adjust based on data, don't repeat identical attempts

## PLUG AND ABANDONMENT

### Regulatory Requirements

**BSEE (US Offshore):**
- Minimum 100 ft cement plug across each flow zone
- Minimum 100 ft cement plug at mudline (surface plug)
- Cement must be tagged from above (verify placement)
- Pressure testing required

**State Requirements (examples):**
- **Texas:** 100 ft cement plug, mechanical bridge plug acceptable
- **California:** Varies by district, typically 100 ft minimum
- **Alaska:** Enhanced requirements for Arctic, permafrost

**International (examples):**
- **Norway (NORSOK D-010):** Two independent well barriers, permanent materials
- **UK (OGUK):** Risk-based approach, environmental barrier mandatory
- **Brazil (ANP):** Formation-specific isolation, permanent abandonment verification

### Plug Placement Techniques

```
BALANCED PLUG TECHNIQUE (Most Reliable)

CONCEPT: Cement placed across interval without contamination

PROCEDURE:
1. Spot calculated volume inside pipe
2. Displace with calculation:
   V_displace = V_annulus (keeps cement stationary in both pipe & annulus)
3. Pull pipe slowly above plug
4. Wait on cement (WOC)
5. Tag plug from above
6. Pressure test (1,000-1,500 psi, 30 min)

VOLUME CALCULATION:
├─ V_cement = Length × (A_pipe + A_annulus)
├─ V_displace = V_annulus to plug depth
└─ Account for: Pipe capacity, annular capacity, densities

ADVANTAGES:
├─ No contamination (if calculated correctly)
├─ Full coverage across interval
└─ Reliable placement

LIMITATIONS:
├─ Requires accurate volume calculations
├─ Cannot verify until set
└─ Risk of U-tubing if imbalanced
```

```
TWO-PLUG METHOD (Positive Verification)

CONCEPT: Set bottom plug, verify, set top plug

PROCEDURE:
1. Run to bottom with pipe/coiled tubing
2. Pump cement (bottom plug)
3. Reverse out, displace, POOH above plug
4. WOC 8-12 hours
5. **Tag plug** (verify hard cement)
6. Pull up calculated distance
7. Pump cement (top plug)
8. Repeat verification

ADVANTAGES:
├─ Positive verification of bottom plug before top
├─ Can adjust top plug placement based on bottom results
└─ Higher confidence in isolation

LIMITATIONS:
├─ Requires two trips
├─ More rig time
└─ Higher cost

APPLICATIONS:
├─ Critical isolations (gas zones, high pressure)
├─ Regulatory requirement in some jurisdictions
└─ Permanent abandonment
```

```
DUMP BAILER (Limited Application)

CONCEPT: Free-fall cement from bailer at depth

PROCEDURE:
1. Load cement in bailer (30-50 bbls capacity)
2. Run to depth on wireline
3. Open bailer (free-fall mechanism)
4. POOH
5. WOC, tag, test

ADVANTAGES:
├─ Simple, low cost
└─ No rig-up of cementing equipment

LIMITATIONS:
├─ Limited volume
├─ Contamination during free-fall
├─ Poor placement control
├─ Low density from water contact
└─ NOT RECOMMENDED for critical plugs

APPLICATIONS:
├─ Temporary abandonment only
├─ Non-critical intervals
└─ Open hole (cannot use in casing efficiently)
```

### Verification Requirements

**Tagging:**
- Run to calculated top of plug
- Attempt to pass with light weight (5-10 klbs)
- Cannot pass = Plug is set
- Record depth, compare to calculated
- Tag pressure test: Set 10-20 klbs on plug (mechanical integrity)

**Pressure testing:**
- Apply 1,000-1,500 psi surface pressure
- Hold 15-30 minutes
- Pressure drop <10% = Pass
- Pressure drop >10% = Fail (re-squeeze or re-plug)

**Logging (optional but recommended):**
- Temperature survey: Identifies cement top (heat of hydration)
- Noise log: Detects flow behind pipe
- CBL: Verifies annular coverage (if plug across perforations/casing)

## COMMON PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

### Lost Returns During Cementing

```
PROBLEM: Partial or total loss of returns during cement job

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. STOP PUMPING (do not continue losing cement)
2. Assess loss severity:
   ├─ Partial (<50% loss): May continue with adjustments
   └─ Total (100% loss): STOP, consult team
3. Monitor wellbore pressure:
   ├─ Increasing: Cement bridging (good - may seal)
   └─ Stable/decreasing: Open path to formation
4. Determine loss depth:
   ├─ Shoe: Exceeded fracture gradient (most common)
   ├─ Above shoe: Weak formation, natural fractures
   └─ Inside casing: Shoe track issue, casing leak

SOLUTIONS BY CAUSE:

ECD EXCEEDED FRACTURE GRADIENT:
├─ Reduce pump rate (lower annular friction)
├─ Stop pumping, allow pressure to bleed off
├─ Resume at lower rate, monitor closely
├─ May add LCM to cement (if prepared)
└─ Accept losses if near end of job (cement in critical zones)

WEAK FORMATION / NATURAL FRACTURES:
├─ Spot LCM pill ahead (if anticipated)
├─ Lightweight cement design (should have been pre-planned)
├─ Stage cementing (isolate loss zone)
└─ Reverse circulation cementing (if total losses)

OPERATIONAL ERRORS:
├─ Plug bump too fast: Slow down, control surge
├─ Excessive displacement: Stop before over-displacing cement
└─ Contamination causing bridging: Better spacer design next time

DECISION MATRIX:
├─ >80% cement placed, losses at shoe: Accept, WOC, evaluate
├─ <80% cement placed, losses at shoe: Stop, spot LCM, re-attempt, or run liner
├─ Losses above shoe (weak formation): Stage cement, or accept and squeeze later
└─ Total losses throughout: Abandon cement attempt, mechanical isolation
```

### Gas Migration / Channeling

```
PROBLEM: Gas shows during WOC or post-job (increasing annular pressure, SCVF, SCP)

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Monitor annular pressure continuously during WOC
2. If pressure increasing rapidly: Possible gas influx
   ├─ Do NOT bleed pressure (may create channel path)
   ├─ Allow cement to set, gain strength
   └─ Assess after WOC complete
3. If pressure stable then increases later: Formation gas migration through set cement
4. Run CBL/VDL after WOC: Identify channels, poor bond zones

ROOT CAUSES:
├─ Insufficient gel strength during transition: Slurry design issue
├─ High fluid loss: Dehydration, hydrostatic drop
├─ Contamination: Extended transition period
├─ Poor centralization: Preferential flow paths
├─ Cement shrinkage: Microannulus formation
└─ Formation permeability: Gas invaded cement before impermeability developed

REMEDIATION:
├─ Minor channeling (BI 50-80%, isolated): Monitor, may accept
├─ Significant channeling (BI <50%, gas shows): SQUEEZE REQUIRED
│  ├─ Perforate across gas zone
│  ├─ High-pressure squeeze with thixotropic slurry
│  └─ Multiple attempts if first fails
├─ Microannulus (ultrasonic shows gap): Pressure squeeze, expansion cement
└─ Sustained casing pressure: Annular squeeze, may require multiple attempts

PREVENTION (Future Jobs):
├─ Thixotropic slurry: Bentonite + dispersant, right-angle set
├─ Low fluid loss: <50 mL/30min
├─ Latex system: 10-15% BWOC for gas zones
├─ Expansion additive: 1-3% BWOC
├─ Centralization: 80-90% standoff in gas zones
└─ Continuous pumping: No delays, minimize vulnerable period
```

### Poor Displacement / Contamination

```
PROBLEM: Cement contaminated with mud (soft cement, extended thickening time, low strength)

DIAGNOSIS:
├─ Soft spots while drilling out: Contaminated zones
├─ Lab testing of cement samples: Strength <50% design
├─ Thickening time much longer than expected
└─ CBL shows variable bond quality

ROOT CAUSES:
├─ Insufficient spacer volume: <10 minutes contact time
├─ Inadequate turbulence: Laminar flow, channeling
├─ Poor centralization: <67% standoff, mud not removed
├─ Spacer incompatibility: Did not separate mud from cement
├─ Over-displacement: Pumped cement out of annulus, mud back in
└─ U-tubing: Density inversions, mud migrated upward

IMMEDIATE RESPONSE:
├─ If discovered during drilling out: Note depths, continue
├─ After drilling out: Run CBL, assess severity
├─ If critical zone affected: Remedial squeeze required
└─ If non-critical zone: May accept, monitor

PREVENTION:
├─ Spacer design: Proper density bracketing, rheology, volume
├─ Turbulent flow: Calculate Reynolds number >2,100
├─ Centralization: 80-90% standoff critical zones
├─ Compatibility testing: Pre-job lab tests mandatory
├─ Displacement volume: Calculate precisely, do not over-displace
└─ Simulation: OptiCem/CemCADE pre-job modeling
```

### Insufficient Top of Cement (TOC)

```
PROBLEM: Cement did not reach planned TOC (short column)

DIAGNOSIS:
├─ CBL shows cement lower than expected
├─ Temperature log identifies TOC
└─ Free pipe amplitude higher than anticipated depth

ROOT CAUSES:
├─ Insufficient volume pumped: Calculation error, losses
├─ Losses during job: Cement lost to formation (not detected)
├─ Excess hole volume: Washouts, cave-ins (caliper not accurate)
├─ Cement dehydration: Fluid loss to formation (volume reduction)
└─ Slurry yield lower than designed: Mixing issue, air entrainment

IMMEDIATE RESPONSE:
├─ Assess whether TOC adequate for well integrity:
│  ├─ Above critical zones (gas, water, weak formations): May accept
│  └─ Below critical zones: TOP JOB REQUIRED
├─ If top job required:
│  ├─ Run in hole to above cement
│  ├─ Circulate to verify cement is set
│  ├─ Pump additional cement to planned TOC
│  └─ WOC, verify with CBL or temperature log

PREVENTION:
├─ Accurate volume calculations: Use actual caliper data
├─ Sufficient excess: 30-50% typical, higher if washouts known
├─ Monitor returns: Real-time volume tracking
├─ Fluid loss control: Test slurry, ensure <50 mL/30min
└─ Slurry yield verification: Check density during mixing
