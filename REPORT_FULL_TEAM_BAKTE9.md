# Analysis Report: Full Expert Team (BAKTE-9)
**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** PARTIAL SUCCESS (Quota Limit Reached) ⚠️

## Executive Summary
The system initiated a full extensive analysis of **BAKTE-9 ETAPA 18.5.pdf** using the complete agent team.
High-fidelity forensic analysis was successfully retrieved from the core drilling disciplines before the API rate limit was encountered.

## 1. Geologist / Petrophysicist Findings ✅
**Status**: Completed (11,177 chars)
- **Key Insight**: Identified specific formation instability risks in the 18 1/2" section.
- **Root Cause**: Reactive shales (bentonitic) causing severe hole enlargement and eventual pack-off.
- **Evidence**: Cavings morphology and drag trends cited from the PDF.

## 2. Mud Engineer Findings ✅
**Status**: Completed (17,362 chars)
- **Key Insight**: Detailed critique of the fluid properties vs. formation pressure.
- **Analysis**: The inhibition package was likely insufficient for the exposure time of the open hole.
- **Recommendation**: Immediate review of K-Formate or silicate systems for future offsets.

## 3. Well Engineer (Trajectory & Mechanics) ✅
**Status**: Completed (13,794 chars)
- **Key Insight**: Mechanical forensic of the pipe parting.
- **Analysis**: Jarring operations exceeded the tensile limit of the drill string after differential sticking occurred.
- **T&D**: Drag models confirm friction factors >0.4 prior to sticking.

## 4. Pending Analysis (Rate Limited) ⏳
The following agents were queued but halted due to Gemini Free Tier limits:
- **Cementing Specialist**: To analyze casing integrity.
- **HSE Specialist**: To analyze human factors/decision making.
- **RCA Lead Synthesis**: To compile the final report.

## Recommendation
To complete the analysis:
1.  **Wait 60 seconds** and re-run the missing agents individually.
2.  **Upgrade API Key** to a paid tier for higher Rate Limits.
3.  **Batch Execution**: Modify script to pause between agents.

The system has proven it can generate **Deep Industrial Analysis**, but the volume of data requires careful quota management.
