# Project Next Steps

## Completed: Phase 9 (Real Data Test) ✅
We have successfully:
- Ingested **BAKTE-9 ETAPA 18.5.pdf** and manuals.
- Ran a real-world simulation using **Gemini 2.5 Flash**.
- Generated a detailed RCA report (see `REPORT_BAKTE9.md`).

## Planned: Phase 10 (Agent Expansion) 🔜
According to the roadmap, we are ready to expand the expert team:
1.  **Cementing Specialist**: To analyze cement bond logs and primary cementing jobs.
2.  **HSE Engineer**: To integrate safety protocols and risk assessments.
3.  **Geologist / Petrophysicist**: For deeper formation evaluation (pore pressure/fracture gradient).

## Action Required
Please review `REPORT_BAKTE9.md` to confirm the results of the real data test.
Then, authorize proceeding to **Phase 10**.
