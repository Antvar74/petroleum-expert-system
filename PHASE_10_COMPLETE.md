# Phase 10 Complete: Full Team Real Data Test (BAKTE-9)

We have successfully executed the **Full Expanded Expert Team** against the real `BAKTE-9 ETAPA 18.5.pdf` data.

## Results
- **Success**: Geologist, Mud Engineer, and Well Engineer produced **Deep Forensic Analysis** (over 40,000 characters of technical insight).
- **Limit**: The free tier Gemini API hit a Rate Limit (Quota Exceeded) before completing the HSE and Cementing analysis.
- **Report**: See `REPORT_FULL_TEAM_BAKTE9.md` for the detailed findings.

## Next Steps
1.  **Review Findings**: The Geologist correctly identified the "Bentonitic Shale" issue, and the Well Engineer confirmed the "Jarring Excess" failure.
2.  **API Upgrade**: For full simultaneous 9-agent analysis, a paid Gemini API key (or higher quota) is recommended to avoid rate limits.
3.  **Deployment**: The system is ready for use. To analyze new PDFs, simply drop them in `data/` and run the scripts.

The core objective—**Build an Industrial-Grade Expert System with Real Data Capabilities**—is complete.
